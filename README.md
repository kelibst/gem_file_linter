# gem_file_linter
This is a linter to help correct errors in gem files or to help create one if necessary. 

This program is a linter for Gemfiles in ruby.
  You might say well Ruby doesn't need Gemfile linter,
  buy Hey! nothing is an overkill if it can do the work.





## Built With

- Ruby

### Run tests
To preserve the configuration file of this project,
the script is set to run on a 'gem' instead of the  original Gemfile.

make sure you have ruby installed and run
- bin/main.rb  

- The rspec test files are located in the spec folder.

## Test codes

if you do not have a Gemfile in your working directory, the project will request to create one for you. Then ask to fill it.
if you do have a gem file, the program checks if it includes at least one gem and at least one source url.
